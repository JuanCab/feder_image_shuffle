## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `crazy-object-001R.fit` -- not sure what this is an image of
+ `another-crazy-object-003B.fit` -- this looks more like a flat than a science image.
+ `full-moon-005B.fit` -- nice satellite or plane track in here.

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [ ] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)
- [x] EXAMPLE checked-off box, please delete.

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ `m34-002R.fit` -- no WCS, looks like there were maybe clouds.
+ `m404-001B.fit` -- Not sure what object this, and googling `m404` got me a 404.
+ `sa113-099V.fit` -- No filter in the FITS header, not sure what it should be.
